# Running only the tests your change affects

```powershell
./Test-Changes.ps1 -Explain
./Test-Changes.ps1 -Configuration Debug
./Test-Changes.ps1 -Mode PrePush -Configuration Release
./Test-Changes.ps1 -Mode Full -Configuration Debug
```

The default uses local merge-base changes plus staged, unstaged and untracked work. Read the explanation before a large run. Unknown code/build inputs widen coverage. Selected work is partial evidence. PR delegation is pending CI work, and only an enabled workflow with matching reviewed candidate bytes/profile can justify it.

Native test files use `Scope.Tests.Something.h/.cpp`; register new active files in `native-test-files.json`. `test-scopes.json` owns standalone scope/PR metadata. Shared-library or runtime byte changes conservatively invalidate local standalone reuse. No consumer dependency pin changes are part of this workflow.

For independent resource investigations, force fresh execution and retain paired fixture/build provenance. Timing, native ARM64, real devices, IME/assistive technology and foreground input remain separate qualification requirements. These commands do not manufacture those claims.
```powershell
./Test-Changes.ps1 -Scopes <name> -SkipBuild
./Test-Changes.ps1 -Mode Full -Force
./test.ps1 -Full
```

Repeated unchanged scopes print REUSED. Force reruns them. SkipBuild requires an attestation established by a prior Test-Changes build; stale binaries are rejected. Explicit test.ps1 suite/named-test calls retain the lower-level diagnostic interface. Its ordinary call now routes to affected iteration; Full is explicit. An unknown local comparison ref fails with Git's diagnostic rather than silently selecting no work.
